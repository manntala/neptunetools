These are cuttings and as such are in the care of the customer to propagate and grow into a plant . There is always a risk a cutting may not make it and these are sold with the customer taking on that liability. Our advice would be to allow the cutting ends to air dry for 24 hours once received and then propagate in either pure water or moss.

The deep olive of its gracefully tapered leaves is broken up by lighter green veins that create a contrasting pattern that sits attractively on a palm-like trunk to create an impressive mix of texture and colour that will perfectly finish any design scheme. Liking bight, but indirect light, this Ficus would prefer a west or east-facing window or a shaded area of a south-facing room. Water regularly throughout the summer, making sure that you keep the soil moist but not wet for the best results. Supplied in pots with a water reservoir and water meter. These plants are trees and as such some leaves may not be perfect. Often older leaves can have browning or holes which doesn&#x27;t affect the health of the plant or overall look of the tree.

Unfortunately there was some damage to the plant during transit - one leaf stem was nearly completely broken off on arrival.

However, the plant was well packaged so I would not say it was the seller&#x27;s fault, just bad luck. Minus 1 star because the plant I got looks smaller than the pictures from the listing and the reviews (which is also why it was such a shame one beautiful leaf had to go because of damage), though the size is consistent with the item description.

When the top two inches of soil are dry it&#x27;s time to lightly water this plant, and for the best growth we would recommend misting the leaves once a week and feed with liquid fertilizer once a month in the summer and spring.

Characterised by thin, slender strappy leaves which gracefully droop into a fountain of colour, this is a houseplant that would look great anywhere in your home. The thick white roots that grow from the stem are the feature that make this plant a sight to behold and add a contrasting colour to the green of the leaves which creates a unique display in your home that will fit in well with any colour scheme. Native to South America and used to humid environments this plant would thrive in a steamy bathroom or kitchen but will benefit from regular misting of the leaves in other rooms. Liking bright, but indirect sunlight, this plant is best placed in a corner away from a window. Water once a week, keeping the soil moist but not dry for the best results.

Put this plant in a space that receives full sun throughout the day and water regularly through spring and summer, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. There is no need to water over winter. This plant doesn;t like being cold or wet so keep out of any drafty areas and don&#x27;t put in a bathroom or steamy kitchen. Feed occasionally through the summer and prune dead foliage in late autumn to make way for new growth in the summer. Stephania Erecta Bulb Care When you receive your bulb, you can choose to plant straight away, or leave in a colder dark place to keep dormant until you wish to start the growing process. You should notice a bulge, or small bump on one side. This is the side you want facing up. When ready, place your bulb in a free draining growing media (regular houseplant potting soil with perlite is perfect).

This unusual species of palm is a slow growing house plant that sees its distinctive strap leaved foliage sprout from a woody trunk to create an space filling silhouette that will add a distinctive and unique feature to your home. When young the Liculia Grandis should be kept in a slightly shaded area, but will tolerate more light as it ages.Water lightly only when the top level of the soil has dried out, reducing frequency in winter and make sure you keep it away from cold drafts as they will affect the growth of your plant. Fertilize regularly during the growing season. These plants are already fairly slow growing, but fertilizer will help. Use a slow-release fertilizer two or three times a year.

The foliage is a beautiful dark-green colour with lighter veins running through it. The simple, but bold colours of this plant would accent most design schemes, but work particularly well as a houseplant for scandinavian themed rooms. How much light does a Philodendron need? Philodendron&#x27;s will look after themselves if their basic needs are met. You should put your plant in a bright space with indirect light. Older leaves will turn yellow as they age, but if you find a lot of yellowing leaves then the plant is receiving too much light. A Philodendron that is not receiving enough light will become leggy and the leaves will grow sparsely. How often should I water a Philodendron? You should only water when the top inch of soil is dry. Philodendrons only require light watering and the leaves will begin to droop if you are over or under watering. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot.

The leaves are a dark green with white veins running all over and create a charming display that would lighten up any room of the home. Put this plant in a space that receives full sun throughout the day and water regularly through spring and summer, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. There is no need to water over winter. This plant doesn;t like being cold or wet so keep out of any drafty areas and don&#x27;t put in a bathroom or steamy kitchen. Feed occasionally through the summer and prune dead foliage in late autumn to make way for new growth in the summer. Stephania Erecta Bulb Care When you receive your bulb, you can choose to plant straight away, or leave in a colder dark place to keep dormant until you wish to start the growing process. You should notice a bulge, or small bump on one side. This is the side you want facing up. When ready, place your bulb in a free draining growing media (regular houseplant potting soil with perlite is perfect). Allow half the bulb to be submerged into the soil, and half sticking out the soil. Place in a warm environment and keep the soil moist to encourage growth. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot. Any decorative pots or props are not included.

The foliage is a beautiful dark-green colour with lighter veins running through it. The simple, but bold colours of this plant would accent most design schemes, but work particularly well as a houseplant for scandinavian themed rooms. How much light does a Philodendron need? Philodendron&#x27;s will look after themselves if their basic needs are met. You should put your plant in a bright space with indirect light. Older leaves will turn yellow as they age, but if you find a lot of yellowing leaves then the plant is receiving too much light. A Philodendron that is not receiving enough light will become leggy and the leaves will grow sparsely. How often should I water a Philodendron? You should only water when the top inch of soil is dry. Philodendrons only require light watering and the leaves will begin to droop if you are over or under watering. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot.

The leaves are a dark green with white veins running all over and create a charming display that would lighten up any room of the home. Put this plant in a space that receives full sun throughout the day and water regularly through spring and summer, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. There is no need to water over winter. This plant doesn;t like being cold or wet so keep out of any drafty areas and don&#x27;t put in a bathroom or steamy kitchen. Feed occasionally through the summer and prune dead foliage in late autumn to make way for new growth in the summer. Stephania Erecta Bulb Care When you receive your bulb, you can choose to plant straight away, or leave in a colder dark place to keep dormant until you wish to start the growing process. You should notice a bulge, or small bump on one side. This is the side you want facing up. When ready, place your bulb in a free draining growing media (regular houseplant potting soil with perlite is perfect). Allow half the bulb to be submerged into the soil, and half sticking out the soil. Place in a warm environment and keep the soil moist to encourage growth.

Liking bight, but indirect light, this Ficus would prefer a west or east-facing window or a shaded area of a south-facing room. Water regularly throughout the summer, making sure that you keep the soil moist but not wet for the best results Because this is an air-purifying plant it would make an ideal addition to the office as it impoves not only the look, but also the atmosphere of a space. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot. Any decorative pots or props are not included. These plants are trees and as such some leaves may not be perfect. Often older leaves can have browning or holes which doesn&#x27;t affect the health of the plant or overall look of the tree.

Growing best in bright, indirect light you will get the best results in a room with a south facing window. This plant can tolerate darker rooms, but you may see an effect on leaf colour. During the hotter months we recommend watering once a week to keep the soil evenly moist and reduce in the winter, if the leaves start to turn yellow then reduce frequency of watering. We believe this to be a hybrid Philodendron Verrucosum, however we do not know the parentage. The leave colour is far lighter green compared to our other Verrucosum Inscensi.

The foliage is a beautiful light-green to yellow colour. The simple, but bold colours of this plant would accent most design schemes, but work particularly well as a houseplant for scandinavian themed rooms. How much light does a Philodendron need? Philodendron&#x27;s will look after themselves if their basic needs are met. You should put your plant in a bright space with indirect light. Older leaves will turn yellow as they age, but if you find a lot of yellowing leaves then the plant is receiving too much light. A Philodendron that is not receiving enough light will become leggy and the leaves will grow sparsely. How often should I water a Philodendron? You should only water when the top inch of soil is dry. Philodendrons only require light watering and the leaves will begin to droop if you are over or under watering. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot.

Having not much experience in propagating, I was a bit over cautious and worried about a small black area on the cutting (I thought it was rot). I asked Oliver and Harriet for their advice and Harriet got back very fast. I decided to wait until my cutting had developed roots before I left this review. It has taken around a ml th for the first roots to develop but this is likely down to a few factors including the time of year and the substrate I used to try and root the cutting ( I started with Sphagnum moss which caused the aerial root to start rotting but I saved it.) the cutting arrived well wrapped and protected and although it took a few days (Christmas delivery) to arrive it arrived without any major issues.

The foliage is a beautiful dark-green colour with lighter veins running through it. The simple, but bold colours of this plant would accent most design schemes, but work particularly well as a houseplant for scandinavian themed rooms. How much light does a Philodendron need? Philodendron&#x27;s will look after themselves if their basic needs are met. You should put your plant in a bright space with indirect light. Older leaves will turn yellow as they age, but if you find a lot of yellowing leaves then the plant is receiving too much light. A Philodendron that is not receiving enough light will become leggy and the leaves will grow sparsely. How often should I water a Philodendron? You should only water when the top inch of soil is dry. Philodendrons only require light watering and the leaves will begin to droop if you are over or under watering. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot.

The foliage is a beautiful dark-green colour with lighter veins running through it. The simple, but bold colours of this plant would accent most design schemes, but work particularly well as a houseplant for scandinavian themed rooms. How much light does a Philodendron need? Philodendron&#x27;s will look after themselves if their basic needs are met. You should put your plant in a bright space with indirect light. Older leaves will turn yellow as they age, but if you find a lot of yellowing leaves then the plant is receiving too much light. A Philodendron that is not receiving enough light will become leggy and the leaves will grow sparsely. How often should I water a Philodendron? You should only water when the top inch of soil is dry. Philodendrons only require light watering and the leaves will begin to droop if you are over or under watering. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot.

This rose gives off a medium-strong scent that will blend into the background smells of your garden, but not overpower the space. Your plant will arrive at around 75 cm high in a 3.5L pot and be ready for planting right away. Place in a sunny location that is sheltered from strong winds with well-draining soil. Keep shade to a minimum and avoid planting too close to other plants, so it has room to spread. These plants do not like wet ground, so water only when the top layer is dry. If your garden is naturally wet, incorporate sand or coarse grid and organic matter into the soil to improve drainage. Prune flowers in early march to encourage new and vibrant blooms in the summer. Notes Our Roses are kept dormant until purchase. This means when your rose plant arrived it will have no new growth for the season. Please allow a little time for your plant to wake from it&#x27;s dormant period and start growing What is a Floribunda Rose? Floribunda are a cross-breeding of hybrid tea and polyantha roses that take their name from the Latin for &#x27;many-flowering&#x27;. Prized for their clusters of flowers that bloom over a longer season, they are robust and disease-resistant. Typically smaller and bushier than other roses, floribunda don&#x27;t have as strong a scent than other types. When growing floribunda, you will benefit from deadheading them to prolong colour throughout the season.",http://s3.amazonaws.com/yotpo-images-production/Product/254682403/184214745/original.jpg,Ms W.,cazshore@hotmail.co.uk,GB,,,,,,,,,

This zingy fruit has a slight sweetness to it that is undercut by a slight tartness. These robust and hardy bushes will grow great in your garden where the juicy, red berries add some interesting texture and colour to the space. Because of its slightly tart flavour, this is a wonderful fruit to use in cakes and sweet pies. If you want a simpler way to eat this fruit then serve it with some chutneys and cheese for a fantastic ploughman&#x27;s style lunch. Plant your gooseberry bush in a well-draining soil that receives a good amount of light throughout the day. Give the plant 1.5m to grow in every direction, and water regularly in the first few weeks, and then only until the soil is wet, but not moist. This bush is hardy and resistant to mildew, a common disease found in other gooseberry varieties. Prune browning leaves regularly and cut back any dead foliage in the winter. When to harvest gooseberries? Gooseberries will be ready to pick between June and July. They are fully type when they are soft to the touch. To pick the berry, gently pull it from the stem, if you are too rough then you may damage the fruit. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot.

A reliable cropper of very large fruit of high quality that have an excellent sweet fl avour and are full of antioxidants, Vitamin C and minerals. The fruit is produced in heavy clusters on short sprigs allowing for easy picking. The currants freeze well and are idea for all purposes. Frost resistant due to late flowering. Highly recommended variety.Self fertilePlanting Distance 1.5m apartHeight and Spread 1.5m x 1.5mCrops JulyAn ideal fruit to grow in a container or small garden, the ben hope is a Scottish bred upright and compact blackcurrant that crops from late July. This is a hardy and easy to grow plant that is great for new growers and expert cooks alike . Thick woody stems produce light green serrated leaves and dangling clusters of black fruit that hang in heavy clusters that make them easy to harvest. A great and refreshing fruit packed with minerals and antioxidants that goes well with yogurt, ice cream or on its own the sweet juice of the blackcurrant goes amazing well with lemonade or if crushed up with gin and tonic water.How to look after blackcurrantsBlackcurrants prefer moist, well-drained soil in full sun, or light shade. Feed with a liquid fertilizer once in the spring to encourage a good yield. Repot every 2-3 years into the same pot or slightly larger. Trim back some of the roots and tease away the old soil replacing it with fresh compost. Trim twice-yearly and In July, trim all new side shoots to 5 leaves. In winter, cut back main stems by half and any side shoots back to 2 buds. Any stems that are damaged, dead or out of place can also be removed.How do you harvest blackcurrants?In early to mid-summer, the plant will produce small white or pink flowers that will soon fall off to reveal the young fruit. Over the next few months, the fruit will grow inside and change from green to black. Once the whole fruit has gone black you can harvest the fruit by pinching it and twisting it off the stem. Avoid pulling the fruit as it may not come off completely.How do you store blackcurrants?Once picked a blackcurrant will not last long. If you want to preserve your fruits for longer you can either blend the fruits into a thick juice which you can freeze or freeze whole fruits in an airtight bag.",http://s3.amazonaws.com/yotpo-images-production/Product/266930350/194863999/original.jpg,Clara G.,clara.gormley@gmail.com,GB,,,,,,,,,

I placed 2 orders one day after another.
One order contained a Syngonium Pink Splash and a Philodendron Brandtianum stem cuttings and the other order contained a Monstera Dubai stem cutting.

Somewhere along the line something happened and one of my orders was lost by DPD which meant I never received my Dubai cutting.
I got in touch via email and explained the strange situation and they responded almost immediately and investigated, but with no joy they apologised and proceeded to send me the cutting again.

I just received the cutting today not more than 3 days from the original parcel going missing and they were even nice enough to send me a top cutting instead of a stem cutting, amazing!!

Every time I have ordered from this company I have been astounded by the incredible quality and the condition the cuttings arrive in, will always be my first point of call for exotic plant cuttings and will suggest to people at every opportunity.",5,2021-11-05 17:19:40,anonymous,yotpo_site_reviews,http://www.plantsforallseasons.co.uk,Plants for all Seasons,,,Rhys C.,rhyscroud@gmail.com,GB,,,,,,,,,

Liking bight, but indirect light, this Ficus would prefer a west or east-facing window or a shaded area of a south-facing room. Water regularly throughout the summer, making sure that you keep the soil moist but not wet for the best results. Supplied in pots with a water reservoir and water meter.

The foliage is a beautiful light-green to yellow colour. The simple, but bold colours of this plant would accent most design schemes, but work particularly well as a houseplant for scandinavian themed rooms. How much light does a Philodendron need? Philodendron&#x27;s will look after themselves if their basic needs are met. You should put your plant in a bright space with indirect light. Older leaves will turn yellow as they age, but if you find a lot of yellowing leaves then the plant is receiving too much light. A Philodendron that is not receiving enough light will become leggy and the leaves will grow sparsely. How often should I water a Philodendron? You should only water when the top inch of soil is dry. Philodendrons only require light watering and the leaves will begin to droop if you are over or under watering. Notes Our plants are provided in a plastic nursery pot.

Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer once or twice during the summer, stopping during the winter. Try not to over fertilize as this may cause a build up of salt that may harm the roots.

How to grown maranta This plant prefers bright, indirect light but will do well in lower light conditions, but you may get less spectacular leaves.

Water with filtered water or rainwater, this plant does not handle fluoride well, enough to keep the water moist, but not wet. Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer once or twice during the summer, stopping during the winter. Try not to over fertilize as this may cause a build up of salt that may harm the roots.

This clump forming plant produces broad ribbon like strap leaves that sit on thick stems that look a lot like bamboo. Position in bright, indirect light and keep away from cold drafts. Water with filtered water or rainwater, this plant does not handle fluoride well, enough to keep the water moist, but not wet. Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer once or twice during the summer, stopping during the winter. Try not to over fertilize as this may cause a build up of salt that may harm the roots.

The Azlanii was slightly damaged in transit but the plant itself is really healthy and strong. The root is very established and plentiful. A very beautiful plant.
The ficus is lighter than expected but the plant itself is healthy and well balanced.
The delivery was just a couple of days and the packaging was sturdy (you can&#x27;t stop delivery people from throwing parcels about).
Would definitely recommend Plant for all Seasons and will be buying more in future.
