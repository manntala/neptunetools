I first got a taste of these from my local fit shop, but they were having inventory problems and ran out for like a week, so I decided to get in touch and order them straight from the supplier. I ordered 24 muffins, and they were delivered very quickly and even came with a sample of their amazing cookies!! All I did was stick them in the freezer upon arrival. I eat one of these muffins almost every morning and it literally makes getting out of bed so much more enjoyable. They’re so moist and tasty, and portioned just correctly so that it helps control your intake. I’ve already lost like 4 pounds with a bit of self discipline while still eating these muffins every morning. Thanks so much, Ruth!
